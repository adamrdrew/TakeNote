    title: Update folderHasStarredNotes() in NoteList.swift
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: Added isAllNotes branch to folderHasStarredNotes(); when All Notes is selected it checks sortedNotes directly rather than selectedContainer?.notes (which is always empty for the virtual All Notes container). Falls through to original selectedContainer?.notes path for all other containers.
    touched:
      - TakeNote/Views/NoteList/NoteList.swift
  - id: S002
    title: Update views.md to document the All Notes starred-section behavior
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added documentation in NoteList section explaining the two-branch behavior of folderHasStarredNotes(): the isAllNotes path uses sortedNotes (because All Notes virtual container.notes is always empty), and all other containers use selectedContainer?.notes."
